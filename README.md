# NopeBot

A bot for counting 'nopes', moments where something happens that the noper really doesn't enjoy. 

## Installation
Copy the source files where you want them. Register a new bot following the instructions at https://discordpy-reborn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html, and store the token in the source's parent folder with the name `nope_bot.token`. Add the bot to whichever server you want.
### Dependencies
This program requires the `discord` dependency. Install it using

    pip install discord

## Usage

Execute the .py file to run 

    python nope_bot.py

Note that Discord takes up to 1 hour to register new commands. After that you'll have access to NopeBot's slash commands.
